    <p><b>MChem Chemistry with Year in Industry </b> | <i> The University of Lincoln </i> </p>
    <p>Sept 2015 â€“ Aug 2019 </p>
    <p>Classification: Merit </p>
<p>Significant modules studied:</p>
    Significant modules studied:
  Professional Practice: Formulation chemistry and Pharmaceutical chemistry.
  Core Chemistry: Defining shape, symmetry and stereochemistry, Synthetic methodologies and molecular characterisation, Stability, structure and mechanisms in molecular systems, chemistry of activated systems and radicals.
  Practical Chemistry: Fundamental laboratory techniques, Advanced techniques in IO-Chemistry, Organic synthesis, purification, and characterization.
  Projects:
  Investigating nitrification inhibition in Refinery Wastewater and Reduction of Total Nitrogen:
  This was a placement project with the Humber Refinery to investigate the effects of sulphide and phenols on the performance of their Effluent treatment plant and research ways of modification of existing plant to incorporate an anoxic region to aid Total Nitrogen (TN) Reduction. IC, TOC/TN analyzer and spectrophotometry were used in this project for sample analysis.
  Characterization of Layered Double Hydroxides (Hydrotalcites):
  A self-conducted project in which I used a range of techniques such as PXRD, TGA, XRF, SEM-EDX and IR to characterize samples from the University of Chemistry and Technology in Prague. This was to investigate the properties and the structures of these samples.
